ABOUT BIO::SEQREADER VERSION 0.0.3

Bio::SeqReader provides developers simple-to-use classes for reading sequence
data in standard formats. This currently includes FASTQ only.

Bio::SeqReader::Fastq. The FASTQ format is described formally in Cock PJA,
Fields CJ, Goto N, Heuer ML, Rice PM. (2010) "The Sanger FASTQ file format for
sequences with quality scores, and the Solexa/Illumna FASTQ variants," Nucleic
Acids Research 38. Note that it allows for multiline sequence and quality score
information, and Bio::SeqReader::Fastq is designed to handle this correctly.
